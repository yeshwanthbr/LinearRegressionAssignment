## General Information
- A machine learning project for predicting the demand for shared bikes based on the Bike Sharing data available.
#### Background
- An US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
#### Business Goal
- Model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables which can be used by the management to understand how demand varies. This asseememnt will help in manipulating the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.

#### Data Set
- The available dataset contains the daily count of rental bikes between the years 2018 and 2019 in the bike share system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information. [Data dictionary](data_dictionary.txt)
